# starting-opengl

This is my first project in OpenGL using C++. I have applied all the skills learned from the "Getting Started" section of
[learnopengl.com](learnopengl.com).

When the user starts the application, they are put in a first-person camera view, whereby they can move the camera around with the W,A,S,D
keys, and point the camera with the mouse. They can also zoom in and out by scrolling up and down with the mouse.  
  
In front of the starting position is a collection of cubes that have been arranged to spell out "C++". The colour of the cubes oscillates
between two values over time.

  Also in front of the user is a red power switch. If the user moves the camera on top of the power switch then the switch will turn green
  and the "C++" cubes will start to oscillate back and forth. If the user moves the camera off the switch, then the motion stops.
