# starting-opengl

After finishing parts 1 to 3 of the C++ Primer book, I wanted to start using C++ to make my own projects. I started off by beginning to learn about graphics programming as I've always been fascinated by how graphics work in games. 

  I started by learning about the OpenGL API. This repo stores my first attempt at using OpenGL to create a simple scene.
